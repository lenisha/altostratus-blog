This article will show how to build a blog (or any other static content) using a very popular [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) (**GatsbyJS, GraphQL, Markdown**) and host it on [static website hosting for Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/blog/azure-storage-static-web-hosting-public-preview/), which provides a cost effective and scalable solution for hosting static content and JavaScript code.

We will demonstrate how to optimize the website and provide global reach by enabling **Azure CDN**. And, to make all the blog posts continuously build and deploy to Azure, we will utilize [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/devops/pipelines/). Then, we will provision Azure resources using the simple and powerful language of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and a **Docker** container running inside the pipeline.
