This post summarizes my key takeaways and learnings from KubeCon US 2019 - flagship Cloud Native Conference.
I would like to highlight here ideas, sessions and talks that were especially interesting to me as a Cloud Architect specializing in Application Development and Modernization. Generally it was very humbling and overwhelming experience to see so many bright people and expert talks, and deep dives so I decided to put on hold topics like Networking ( 5G networks, eBPF, K8S on the Edge and Topology Managers) or AI/ML workloads and concentrate of developer experience and operations — and there was plenty sessions to choose from. So here are the key points I took away:

- GitOps is the new DevOps
- Clusters are cattle not pets
- User Experience and too much Tooling
- Case Studies — DOD and Ottawa
- Operators — are here to help?
- Security — think in graphs
- Service Mesh and WebAssembly
- Policy everywhere
