This is part 1 of a 2-part series demonstrating how to leverage advanced [Azure SQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/sql-database/) (PaaS) features from Java Spring Boot applications running on [PCF](https://pivotal.io/platform) (Pivotal CloudFoundry) on Azure. The first article will show you how to use a Spring Boot application with Azure SQL Database auto-failover groups to provide resilience to regional outages, and the next article will show you how to use the Azure SQL AlwaysEncrypted feature in Spring Boot applications to provide encryption for PI data in the cloud.

This article demonstrates how to use Azure SQL auto-failover groups in SpringBoot applications running on PCF, configuring  for the seamless integration of the Java apps with Azure services and using Service Broker to connect PCF applications with Azure SQL service.
